*** what is $guarded = ['id'] ->> is the inverse of the $fillable , guarded make any column within it not mass assignment
 and other columns it willbe mass assignment,
 you can put it into model such that `protected $guarded = ['id']`

 *** standard Stub Model content that you need to follow when you start new project
 <?php

namespace {{ namespace }};

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class {{ class }} extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    /**
     * The table associated with the model.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $table = '';

    /**
     * The attributes that are guarded from mass assignment.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $guarded = ['id'];

    ##-------------- Relationships

    ##-------------- Custome Function

    ##-------------- Attributes

}




*** another modification in stub request is make method authorized return true such that
    /**
     * Determine if the user is authorized to make this request.
     */
    public function authorize(): bool
    {
        return true;
    }


--------------------------------------------------------------------
when you deel with seeder files it is prefere to deal with `updateOrCreate` rather than
`create` specially when you have record in Database unique such as email

User::updateOrCreate(['email' => '005@mail.com'], [
    'name' => 'Ali',
    'password' => bcrypt('1234567890'),
])
