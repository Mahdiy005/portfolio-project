*** You can use resource for any model even you don't create the controller of type resource,
resource is just way to define routes of CRUD operation


*** in the method of controller fi you have more that variable 7 vars , and you need to pass them without using
compact('data1', 'data2', 'data3', 'data4', 'data5', 'data6')    -> not practical
rather we use `get_defined_vars()` method
