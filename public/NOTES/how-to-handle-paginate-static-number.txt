*** if you need to share specific variable ?
    - you need to put it in any configuration files , specific in `config/`
    - you can create your own php file such `config/paginate.php`
    - within this file return array with key and value such that
        <?php
            return [
                'share' => 'variable'
            ];
    - to access this variable you can use this function `config('fileNameWithinConfig', 'keyThatReturnInThisFile'')
     such that -> config('paginate.share')
